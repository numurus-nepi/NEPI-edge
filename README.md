# Software toolkit for Robotic and AI automation software development

NEPI Engine breaks the trend of every company repeatedly building and maintaining the same set of low-level drivers and middleware for every product generation. NEPI Engine, a Linux distro, allows you to focus on the end-product solution and off-load low-level coding to NEPI, significantly reducing the time and cost of  developing your next great innovation.

NEPI combines plug-and-play abstracted sensor drivers, robotic backseat drivers, and comms drivers and drag-and-drop AI and automation tools with a suite of Ai, data and system management services. NEPI is a key part of what powers industrial AI and automation at the edge.

NEPI Engine is supported on all NVIDIA Jetson GPU family of chipsets.
